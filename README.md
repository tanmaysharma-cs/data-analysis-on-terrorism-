# data-analysis-on-terrorism-
This was my effort of analyze and come up with useful insights on the terrorism dataset that I obtained from kaggle

This was a part of my data analyst internship under "The Sparks Foundation"

I had fun completing the project specially when I was plotting graphs which made me realize the power of data. I hope you have just as much fun as I did
